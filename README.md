## eCommerce UI with Flutter Augmented Reality (ARKit)

This Flutter project combines an elegant eCommerce user interface with augmented reality (AR) functionality using ARKit. The integration of AR brings a new dimension to the user experience by allowing customers to visualize products in their real-world environment.

### Features:
- **Flutter UI**: A sleek and intuitive user interface for browsing products.
- **Augmented Reality (AR)**: Integration of ARKit for iOS devices to display 3D models of products in real-world environments.
- **Product Visualization**: Users can tap on products to view them in AR, providing a more immersive shopping experience.

- **`lib/models/product.dart`**: Defines the product model including attributes like name, price, image, and 3D model path.
- **`assets/`**: Directory containing product images and 3D model files.

### How to Use:
